That's an interesting project idea! It sounds like you're aiming to build a **real-time ride-sharing app** with a focus on dynamic pooling based on proximity and route matching. Let me help you break this down into actionable features and considerations:

---

### Key Features

1. **User Registration and Profiles**  
   - Allow users to sign up/log in via email, phone, or social accounts.  
   - Users should have profiles with photos, contact information, and optional reviews.

2. **Source & Destination Input**  
   - Users enter their start and end locations using an interactive map (Google Maps/Mapbox).  
   - Option to save frequent routes (e.g., home to office).

3. **Real-Time Location Tracking**  
   - Continuous location updates for the traveling user.  
   - Notify other users within a specified radius (100m) about the route.

4. **Ride Alerts**  
   - Nearby users receive alerts via push notifications or in-app messages.  
   - Include details like the current route, expected arrival time, and cost.

5. **Matching Algorithm**  
   - Match nearby users dynamically based on:  
     - Proximity to the current route.  
     - Space availability in the vehicle.  
     - Time flexibility.

6. **In-App Communication**  
   - Provide chat or call options for ride coordination.  
   - Ensure privacy by using temporary phone numbers.

7. **Payment System**  
   - Calculate fare based on distance or time.  
   - Integrate payment gateways like Stripe, Razorpay, or PayPal.  
   - Offer multiple options: cash, card, or wallet payments.

8. **Safety Features**  
   - Allow riders to share trip details with emergency contacts.  
   - Add a panic button for emergencies.  
   - Driver and rider verification through documents.

9. **Rating and Feedback System**  
   - Enable users to rate their ride experience and provide feedback.

### Technical Stack

1. **Frontend (Mobile App)**  
   - **Flutter**: Cross-platform app for Android and iOS.  
   - Use packages like `google_maps_flutter` for maps and `geolocator` for location tracking.

2. **Backend**  
   - **Node.js/Spring Boot**: For RESTful APIs.  
   - Real-time notifications using **WebSockets** or Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).

3. **Database**  
   - **MongoDB**: To store user data, ride history, and location logs.  
   - **Redis**: For caching active user locations for faster proximity checks.

4. **Location Services**  
   - Google Maps API: Directions API for route calculation, Places API for location input.  
   - Geofencing APIs to detect users within a 100m radius.

5. **Payment Integration**  
   - Stripe or Razorpay for secure transactions.  

6. **Hosting**  
   - **AWS/GCP**: To host your backend and manage server scaling.

### Challenges to Address

1. **Accuracy of Location Tracking**  
   - GPS accuracy can vary based on network and environment.

2. **Privacy Concerns**  
   - Ensure user data (location, profile) is securely stored and not misused.  
   - Allow users to opt out of being notified if they donâ€™t want to participate.

3. **Fair Pricing System**  
   - Dynamic pricing (based on demand or route length) or fixed rates?  
   - Transparent breakdown of fare for riders.

4. **Legal Compliance**  
   - Ensure compliance with local ride-sharing regulations.  
   - Address liability concerns in case of accidents or disputes.

5. **User Adoption**  
   - The success depends on having enough active users for consistent matches.

### MVP Scope (Minimum Viable Product)
Start small and scale:
1. User login/registration.
2. Enter source/destination with live tracking.
3. Notify nearby users about the ride.
4. Basic fare estimation and manual payment handling.
5. A feedback/rating system for rides.
